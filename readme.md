First you need to do is run this simple commands in your terminal:

pip install face_recognition
pip install pybind11

And all side soft are installed and up to date, Ready for be used by some kind of dumbass like me

So, i think, that you need to know this thing:
To setup this application on your computer, first you need to run "python pybind_setup.py build_ext -i" 
The reason you need to do this is cause I am using an pybind11 library, which for connection between python and C++ scripts, using an build files, and for every system, computer or some kinda of configuration this file is unique, so just build it, this is not too hard, just do it
